        opinion: 'While "Clean Architecture" focuses on designing software systems and their overall structure, "Clean Code" dives into the details of writing clean and readable code. Both books complement each other exceptionally well imho',

        opinion: 'A great and enjoyable read. I really loved reading this book. Gave me a wider perspective of coding and software development. Currently learning Frontend Development but this book showed me how wide programming really is. The concepts in the book might be from the past but they are applicable timelessly. If you are coding this book must be on your shelf.',

        opinion: 'This book was a great companion in the process of learning C++ around half a year in the process. It covers many need-to-know subjects and intricacies about the language in the first many chapters. In the late chapters more advanced features are described. I like it.',

        opinion: 'The need for performance is back: While performance was not the most important topic during the crazy clockspeed improvements in the 90s and 2000s, today performance again plays a major role in software development. Whether it is to reduce costs when computing something in the cloud or to increase the duration of your battery, performance is important again, and in particular in C++.',

        opinion: 'Amazing book! The author combined many things that been in industry for a long and put it into a properly structured way, with a good reasoning about why something was like that and what we probably should do to avoid common mistakes, etc. You can read the whole book in a day or two yet the value you get from it is completely priceless! 10/10',

        opinion: 'This is one of the best technical books I have ever read. Not only is it comprehensive and thorough, but also comprehensible. Martin Kleppmann has a knack for explaining things in a manner that is easy to understand and follow, even if their complexity is non-trivial.',
